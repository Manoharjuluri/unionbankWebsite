      <h4>The Vehicle Loan Meaning</h4>
      <p>A vehicle loan allows you to buy any vehicle for personal use. The lender is known to make a direct payment to
        the dealer on the buyer's behalf while the buyer pays back the loan in EMIs over a specific time period.</p>
      <p>Here are a few tips on how to make better financial decisions when buying a car:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Before buying a new car, bear in mind that the decision should be made carefully, whether you can afford it
          or not. In addition to the actual buying price, there are several other expenses which will affect your
          monthly budget like Insurance, Maintenance, Gas.</li>
        <li>These days, getting a vehicle loan has become a simple process. Basic questions you might think about are
          How much car loan can I get on a 40000 salary? What will be the vehicle loan interest rate? etc. Several
          people nowadays are becoming unworried and consequently paying a lot more than they should. Some people handle
          the expense of the car and other upfront charges while others realize later that they had misjudged their
          financial capabilities.</li>
        <li>When it comes to buying a car, smart buyers power their existing relationships with lenders; they shop
          around to get the best deal, not just in terms of the lowest EMI but in terms of the lowest outgoing overall.
          They make sure to inspect every detail with care before committing to a deal. Union Bank of India offers a
          vehicle loan EMI calculator to help you make a wise choice.</li>
        <li>One more smart decision you make is protecting yourself during the buying experience. For instance, most
          consumers are unaware of the fact that they can easily save nearly 40% on their new car insurance by shopping
          for it directly instead of going buying it through a dealer.</li>
        <li>Another money-saving tip for consumers is purchasing vehicle accessories via an independent vendor, saving
          as much as 20-80% off on the original cost.</li>
      </ul>
